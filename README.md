# Sliding Puzzle Challenge

Move the numbered tiles around until they are in numerical order. You can only move a tile to an adjacent empty space. Just click on a tile to move it. Once the tiles are in the right place, a special moment in New York Giants history will be displayed. For an even more challenging game, turn off the tile numbers and try to unscramble based on the image only.
